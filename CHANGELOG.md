# CHANGE LOG

**This is an attempt to revive `graphql-request` ❤️.**


### v2.0.0 (6 Mai 2020)
  - remove all duplicated code.
  - add more options.
  - isomorphic with `Axios` over `fetch polyfill`.
  - use one method for request (like __*rawRequest*__, add `pureDataResponse` as `true` inside the object opts to be like __*request*__).
  - combine the 2 headers methods.
  - support queries under `GET` method.
  - lighter than `graphql-request`.
