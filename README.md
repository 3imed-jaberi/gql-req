‚ú® Minimal and ultra Lightweight GraphQL client <small>(lighter then `graphql-request` ‚ö°Ô∏è)<small> that supports Node and browsers for scripts or simple apps üöÄ. 

**This is an attempt to revive [`graphql-request`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request) ‚ù§Ô∏è.**

## `Features`

- ü¶Ñ Inspired from `graphql-request` (with almost identical interface).
- üî• Most **simple and lightweight** GraphQL client <small>(Lighter then `graphql-request`)<small>.
- ‚öñÔ∏è Tiny Bundle: 1.515 kB (gzip)
- üìå Promise-based API (works with `async` / `await`).
- ‚ú® Isomorphic through `Axios`.
- üéØ Supports queries through `POST` and `GET`.
- üéâ Typescript support.


## `Limitation`

- üöß No front-end integration.
- üöß No Cache System.
- üöß No Subscription aka WS <small>(WebSocket)</small> support.


## `Installation`

```bash
# npm
npm install gql-req

## yarn 
yarn add gql-req
```


### `API`

  - `GraphQLClient` &mdash; class for create re-useable client.
  - `request` &mdash; funcs for plain request. 
 
#### Options

The [Options type](https://github.com/3imed-jaberi/gql-req/blob/master/src/index.ts#L12-L16) adopts the [AxiosRequestConfig type](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/index.d.ts#L44-L74) but with few additions and changes.

  - `method` &mdash; http method used to connect with graphql server <small>('GET'/'POST', 'POST' as default)</small>.         
  - `headers` &mdash; key-value object that definite the headers. 
  - `pureDataResponse` &mdash; Unlike graphql-request, I have found __*rawRequest*__ method and __*Request*__ <br/> method are same, for that this option was created. if this option is `true`, the result is equal <br/> to `Request` result <small>(`false` as default)</small>.


## `Usage`

```js
const { request, GraphQLClient } = require('gql-req');

// Run GraphQL queries/mutations using a static function (plain request)
request(endpoint, { query, variables }).then(data => console.log(data));

// ... or create a GraphQL client instance to send requests (re-useable client)
// ... you can also update the header by use `setHeaders` method
// setHeaders(key: string, value: string)
// setHeaders(headers: Headers) with Headers = { [key:string]: string }
const client = new GraphQLClient(endpoint, { headers: {} });
client.request(query, variables).then(data => console.log(data));
```

## `FAQ`

### Why `gql-req` over graphql-request?

Lighter by more then 2 kB, support queries under 'GET' request.

### What's the difference between `gql-req`, Apollo and Relay?

like `graphql-request`, `gql-req` is perfect for small scripts or simple apps.

Compared to GraphQL clients like Apollo or Relay, `gql-req` doesn't have a built-in cache and has no integrations for frontend frameworks. The goal is to keep the package and API as minimal as possible.

### So what about Lokka?

Lokka is great but it still requires [a lot of setup code](https://github.com/kadirahq/lokka-transport-http) to be able to send a simple GraphQL query. `gql-req` does less work compared to Lokka but is a lot simpler to use.
